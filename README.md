Hi, This repo will consist of the solutions to every leetcode problem I'll be solving from now on. The format of the repo is such that I'll create a folder for each of the question I solve with the folder name being L followed by the question number. 
The purpose of creating this repo is to become more comfortable with using GitHub and also work on explanations of my code.

Cheers and will see you around!!:))
