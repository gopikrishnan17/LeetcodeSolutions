    "<b>Question:</b>\n",
    "You are given an m x n integer matrix points (0-indexed). Starting with 0 points, you want to maximize the number of points you can get from the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain points, you must pick one cell in each row. Picking the cell at coordinates (r, c) will add points[r][c] to your score.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you will lose points if you pick a cell too far from the cell that you picked in the previous row. For every two adjacent rows r and r + 1 (where 0 <= r < m - 1), picking cells at coordinates (r, c1) and (r + 1, c2) will subtract abs(c1 - c2) from your score.\n",

    "<b>Approach:</b>\n",
    "The question wasn't very intuitive but solving questions 931 and 1014 gave much more perspective. So the initial idea I had is for each element after 1st row, check the max points which can be added from the previous row. This approach has complexity 0(m*n^2) which has to be brought down.\n",
