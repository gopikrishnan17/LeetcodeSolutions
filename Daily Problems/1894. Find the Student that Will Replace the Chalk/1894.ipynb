    "The brute force approach or simulation approach here would be to keep traversing all the elements in the list and reduce k by whatever is the element and find out when the chalk gets over. This results in multple traversals of the list, to avoid this, we first get the remainder of k when divided by the sum of the list. This ensures that we traverse the list only once. Then we traverse the list and check when k is turning negative or zero. If k is negative, that index is the answer and if it is 0 then the next is the answer.\n",
