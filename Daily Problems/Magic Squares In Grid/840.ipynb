    "SOthis question is tricky because there are a lot of conditions to be checked and once all of them have been figured out then it can be easily solved. The conditions to be checked are: Number should be in range [0,9], all rows should have same sum, all columns should have same sum, both diagonals should have same sum, all numbers in the grid should be unique. We'll traverse through all the elements in the grid that can be the starting point of a 3x3 matrix and check if that matrix is a Magic matrix.\n",
