    "<b>Question:</b>\n",
    "At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an integer array bills where bills[i] is the bill the ith customer pays, return true if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or false otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    " <b>Constraints:</b>\n",
    " 1 <= bills.length <= 10^5\n",
    "\n",
    "bills[i] is either 5, 10, or 20.\n"

    "<b>Approach:</b>\n",
    "Its a pretty easy question, so since there are 3 denominations, 5, 10 and 20 and the lemonade costs 5, we gotta give balance to 10 and 20. For 10 we gotta have a 5 to give the balance and for 20 we can either give 10+5 or 3*5 but 10+5 is preferred since we gotta save the 5s (lol)."
