    "So I wasnt able to solve the question using my approach which was to first take the absolutes of logs of each of the probabilities. We take the logs because then we can just add the probabilities and that value will be the log of its multiplication: log(a*b)=log(a) + log(b). So what we do here is to use dijkstra's algo  to find the shortest path and then convert it to normal value. Will look into why this approach didnt work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach that worked is to find greedily which path to prioritise among the paths available and that is found using a maxheap.so we multiply the probabilities and we keep proceeding first with the path with max probabilities to reach the destination.\n",
